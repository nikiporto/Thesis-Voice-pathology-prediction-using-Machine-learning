Voice Pathology Prediction Using Machine Learning

**Overview**: This repository contains the code and resources for my thesis, which focuses on predicting voice pathologies using machine learning techniques. The goal of this project is to develop a model that can accurately determine whether a person has a voice pathology based on their vocal recordings.

**Data**: The dataset comprises WAV files of individuals pronouncing the vowels 'a', 'i', and 'u'. These audio recordings were processed to extract relevant features for analysis.

**Methodology**: Feature Extraction MFCC (Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients): Extracted MFCC features from the audio recordings to represent the short-term power spectrum of the sound. Dimension Reduction Applied various dimension reduction techniques to improve the efficiency and performance of the machine learning models.

**Machine Learning Models**: Implemented and evaluated several machine learning algorithms to classify the presence of voice pathologies: 1.Support Vector Machine (SVM) 2.k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) 3.Random Forest 4.Naive Bayes 5.Gradient Boosting

**Results**: The performance of each model was evaluated using standard metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The models were trained and tested on the extracted features, and the results were compared to identify the best-performing algorithm.

The files uploaded are for the vowel 'a'. The same methology was used the vowels 'i' and 'u'.
